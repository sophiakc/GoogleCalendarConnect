1. Followed the official [Google Calendar API guide](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/auth)
2. Fixed the code syntax to be Swift/ XCode 8.0 compliant.
3. Fixed the error from: import GoogleAPIClient. By 'pod install' in console again. Clean. Build.
4. Error not yet fixed: [error 403](error 403 disallowed_useragent.png). Didn't find a way to solve it. I am not the [only one](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40565224/ios-quickstart-example-for-gmail-by-google-does-not-work).
